FedMedTL: Enhancing Dermatological Diagnosis with a Personalized Federated Transfer Learning Approach for Skin Cancer Classification

Medical professionals rely on image classification techniques to diagnose complicated medical conditions, including skin cancer. Traditional machine learning methods, such as Federated Learning (FL), face privacy and security concerns due to data heterogeneity and differences in patient populations across medical institutions. This paper develops a Transfer Learning-Optimized Federated Model that performs Personalized Medical Imaging. FedMedTL uses Transfer Learning (Transfer Learning-Optimized Federated Model for Medical Imaging) to advance skin cancer classifying systems. The model integrates Federated learning, Transfer learning, Homomorphic encryption, and Dynamic clustering to address challenges. Data privacy, together with model accuracy and medical institution heterogeneity, receive solutions through the combination of Federated Learning with Transfer Learning alongside Homomorphic Encryption and Dynamic Clustering. The experimental setup contains data distribution into 6:2:2, while Dirichlet distribution is applied to model the heterogeneity of data. Swin Transformers and AlexNet architecture are used as the basis for the local training process. Personalization factors were implied to evaluate the model and its performance. The proposed FedMedTL achieves the highest AUC of 0.98, defining its ability to distinguish between classes while effectively minimizing false positives. While FedCo has 0.92, FedBN has 0.91, AdvFed shows 0.91, ProxFed has 0.90, FedAP has 0.90, and FedMA has 0.91 AUC.
